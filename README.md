Passerby Park is a graphical research emulator for studying the behaviors of [Passerby](https://github.com/noahlevenson/passerby) networks. Using Passerby Park, you can create emulated networks of varying sizes and geographical distributions, issue commands to peers, and visualize the results. 

The Passerby Park renderer attempts to align its screenspace transformations with those of OpenStreetMap &mdash; that is, on-screen distances are (mostly) accurate with respect to map details. Passerby Park visualizes a variety of network activity &mdash; including peer locations, realtime network traffic, search boundaries, and search results &mdash; with the intention of helping investigators quickly develop a geometric intuition for the correctness of the distributed algorithms.
