Passerby Park is a graphical research emulator for studying the behaviors of [Passerby](https://github.com/noahlevenson/passerby) networks. Using Passerby Park, you can create local test networks of varying sizes and geographic distributions, where each emulated peer runs a real instance of the [Passerby](https://github.com/noahlevenson/passerby) protocol. Protocol functions can be executed from any peer's perspective using a browser-based GUI.

The Passerby Park renderer attempts to align its screenspace transformations with those of OpenStreetMap &mdash; that is, on-screen distances are (mostly) accurate with respect to map details. Passerby Park visualizes a variety of network activity &mdash; including peer locations, realtime network traffic, search boundaries, and search results &mdash; with the intention of helping investigators quickly develop a geometric intuition for the correctness of the distributed algorithms.
